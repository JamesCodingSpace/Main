# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ TINF23 MGH

Welcome to my coding space in connection with my applied computer science studies
at the DHBW campus in Bad Mergentheim.

Here you will see updates on my learning progress in Python and HTML.

Updates should be published regularly under "Discussions".
Code can be found in the folder "Notebooks".
Here I try to keep an order, if possible.

Have fun and join me on my journey.

Jamie
